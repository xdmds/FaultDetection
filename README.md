heartbeat

1. Navigate to the "jar files" directory containing HeartBeat.jar, Receiver.jar, and Server.jar. They All need to be in the same directory

2. Run the following command "java -jar HeartBeat.jar" in the command line

3. Port 40002 must be open for this to run properly. If it doesnâ€™t run properly, make sure that port is open.

Output will be as follows

-A print statement before starting the Server and Receiver processes<br/>
-A print statement after starting the Server and Receiver processes<br/>
-A print statement stating what integer the crash generator generated. If it generates a "1", the server process will "fail"<br/>
	&nbsp;-If the Server process fails, a print statement will say the server process is destroyed and restarting<br/>
	-The server process will be destroyed, then restarted in 3 seconds.<br/>
	-The Receiver will notice it is no longer connected to the Server and didn't receive a heartbeat message.<br/>
	-Receiver prints this information<br/>
	-Normal operation will resume once the server process is restarted.<br/>
-print statements with a boolean stating whether or not each process is alive (Monitors kind of implements ping echo. This can easily be removed if we only want heartbeat)<br/>
-print statement with the message the Server sends<br/>
-print statement with the message the Receiver gets<br/>
